Your Laptop
   ↓
Linux VM (bridged, 192.168.0.21)
   ↓
Minikube (VirtualBox/VM driver, 192.168.59.100)
   ↓
Pod (10.244.0.12)


OPTION 1 (Fastest): SSH port forwarding (works 100%)

From your host machine:

ssh -L 30090:192.168.59.100:30090 sultantalib@192.168.0.21


Then open in browser:

http://localhost:30090


🔥 This is the cleanest workaround for labs.
